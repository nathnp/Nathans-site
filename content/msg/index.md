# Rules
</center>

<h2>1. The Object of the Game</h2>
<hr>

The object of the game is to collect as few Points of Shame (see section 3) as possible. The contestant who collects the most Points of Shame at the end of a ski season earns the title of POS (Piece of Shit/Prince of Shame) for that season.

After 10 years of play, the total number of seasonal POS are added together, and the player with the most seasonal POS becomes the POS of the Decade[^1].

<h2>2. Contestants</h2>
<hr>

A contestant is only eligible to participate in the Master Ski Game if:

<ol type="a">
	<li>
		The potential participant is a skier. As it is the Master Ski Game, skiboarders, sledders, and
		snowboarder filth are not eligible for participation. Furthermore, skiblades are eligible, but
		highly frowned upon, and should be avoided if possible.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		The potential participant has been skiing before. As it is the Master Ski Game, complete 
		beginners are not eligible. It is to be noted that, while a contestant is eligible after his first 
		skiing trip, it is suggested that a potential participant complete one skiing season before 
		participating.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		The potential participant must be physically able to ski during the majority of the ski season.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Falling</h2>
<hr>

Falling is defined as a point where a contestant comes to a complete or almost complete stop with either a hip, shoulder, buttock, or combination thereof in contact with the slope.

<h2>4. Points of Shame</h2>
<hr>

<h3>1. Primary Points</h3>
<ol type="a">
	<li>
		The contestant will receive two Points of Shame per fall on a Green Circle slope.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		The contestant will receive one Point of Shame per fall on either a Blue Square or a Black Diamond slope.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		The contestant will receive two Points of Shame per fall on a Double Black Diamond slope.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Falling in a terrain park (of any difficulty level) rewards no Points of Shame.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Extra Points</h3>
<ol type="a">
	<li>
		The contestant will receive five Points of Shame if he falls while entering or exiting the chairlift.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Gloating of skiing ability before a run, doubles the points awarded. This modifier expires at the end of the gloated run.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>5. Disqualification</h2>
<hr>

If at any point in time a contestant leaves the resort before the rest of their party. Exceptions include but are limited to, family emergencies, and life threatening emergencies.

[^1]: If a single contestant earns all 10 seasonal POS titles, he becomes the POS for Life (Dumb Fuck).
