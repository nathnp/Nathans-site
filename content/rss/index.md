If you want an easy way to keep up with what I post, then RSS is the way to go. RSS lets you check one program (or site) to catch up on a large number of things.

This website has a number of RSS feeds. Take a look below for a breakdown, and links.

<h2>Main Blog</h2>
<hr>

 For the main one[^1], just put `https://nthp.me` into your RSS reader, it'll automatically find the right link. Or you can just click this button.

<a class="button" href="/posts/feed.xml">Subscribe to main RSS feed</a>
</center>

Each tag also has its own RSS feed. This let's you subscribe to just one, or more than one thing I like to talk about here. Head on over to the [tags](/tags) page and take a look.

<h2>Fatorio Blog</h2>
<hr>

You can also subscribe to my [Factorio blog](/factorio-blog)'s feed if you'd like, at `https://nthp.me/factorio-blog/feed.xml`. Or click this button.
