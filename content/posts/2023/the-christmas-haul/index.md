Another year, and another Christmas. This was my first real Christmas working in loss prevention. And man, for a number of people, the worst comes out at Christmas. But Iâ€™m not here to talk about what people took[^1], letâ€™s go over what I got[^2]. 

I only asked for two main things, and I ended up getting both, and something extra. The main thing I got was a ski and boot bag. This will be great for my upcoming ski trip in Colorado. The other main thing I got was a Baltimore Ravens Lamar Jackson jersey. 

Other than that, it was a pretty calm Christmas. Nothing truly crazy at work, and I got to have dinner with some family down south. 

But the greatest gift of all this Christmas, the Ravens beat the 49ers 33 to 19 ðŸŽ‰. 

[^1]: Just stolen credit cards and scooters. 

[^2]: As gifts, I didnâ€™t steal them.
