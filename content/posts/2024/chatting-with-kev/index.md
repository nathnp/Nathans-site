[A while back](/posts/2023/pen-pal-things/), I posted about how I hopped into [Kev's](https://kevquirk.com) penpal project. We chatted about a number of things. From UNiFi devices, blog hosting, and students using LLMs to do their projects[^1].

I'm really happy that I got to participate in the project. And might try to find some penpals of my own. If you'd like to read the conversation, you can do so here -> [/etc/penpals-with-kev](/etc/penpals-with-kev).

P.S Kev, üèà > ‚öΩÔ∏è :P

[^1]: And how I catch them.
