It’s been a long time since I’ve had a day off. Working two jobs will do that. And while my second job is really low effort[^1], it’s still work. Emails to check, slack DMs to respond to, students to deal with. 

Today is different, I took the day off from my main job[^2], as I’m recover from a quick cold. A day without work, it always feels weird. My plan for yesterday was to hit up the local Panera Bread and do some writing... That didn’t happen.

I’m still waiting to hear back from Valve on my Steam Deck. I sent it in for warranty repair, and it was marked delivered on Friday. I’m hoping it gets back before my flight to Denver. That’s 31 days away, so I’m not overly worried.

As for today, I’m just going to enjoy being off.

[^1]: I mostly just have to sit at my computer and answer student’s questions. I could go on about teaching students about Linux (and the headaches), but the feds are touchy about how staff talk about students (for good reason).
[^2]: The one where I have tons of sick time.
