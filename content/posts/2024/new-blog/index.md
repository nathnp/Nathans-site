Quick post, I've started a new blog! Don't worry, nothing is happening to this one.

This new one is solely for my progress in Factorio, one of my favorite games. You can actually see it up in the nav bar.

<h2>So, what's changing?</h2>
<hr>

For this blog, nothing. The new posts won't show up in this RSS feed, and won't show up in the post listing page for my main blog. This new blog has its own RSS feed, and its own post listing page. Nothing on my main blog is changing.

<h2>Where is this new blog?</h2>

Right here, on nthp.me. you just have to goto [/factorio-blog](/factorio-blog).
