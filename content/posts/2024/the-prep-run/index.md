Today was prep day. In a few weeks, I'll be flying out to ski in the rockies. So I needed to do a warm up run.

It was about 23F[^2] at Whitetail Resort. Not my preferred skiing temperature[^1] but it was good enough. This being the east coast, there wasn't any snow, it was all ice. The ice coast.

The big "snow" guns you see in the photos, don't make snow. They make small things of ice. And they are not fun[^3] to ski in front of.

My friend who lives in Denver, told me to get plenty of turns in. I think I did, but I'll find out in the morning.
