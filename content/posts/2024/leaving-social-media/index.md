I’ve been thinking for a while now, about leaving social media. The last network I’m on is Mastodon, and I’m getting kinda tired of it. 

<h2>Where To Go?</h2>
<hr>

I’m currently working on a post called “The Network That Isn’t”, that’ll go over my biggest concern about Mastodon. In short, the bigger the network grows, the more issues it has under its own weight. 

I’m not going to Blue Sky. While there’s a number of things I like about it under the hood. There’s also a number of things I don’t like about it.

<h2>What About Here?</h2>

I’ve been playing around with adding micro posts to my site, and the ability to easily post from my phone. My one issue, is that I can’t really add a photo to a micro post, at least from my phone. But, I might just leave it like that. 

I’m still debating about deploying it. As I am with fully leaving Mastodon [lkhrs style](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2024/timeline-era/).

I think for now, I’m just going to take a break, uninstall my Mastodon client, and just relax.
