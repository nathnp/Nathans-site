Earlier today I went to see Wonka. A prequel to one of the Wonka movies[^1]. After seeing the good ratings, and loving the original. I picked up a ticket to my local Warehouse Cinema. And gave it a watch.


<details><summary>SPOILERS!!!!</summary>

<p class='notice'>This is going to be a bit rambly, I've only see the movie the once.</p>

I was pretty skeptical going in. Alright, I was very skeptical going in. I am a big fan of the original movie. So I was wondering, will this be a prequel to the original, or the 2005 film. Wonka goes for the original, both in the story(ish), and in the mannerisms of Wonka.

The trailer really set that, showing an orange Oompa Loompa. That Oompa Loompa, was also the only one in the movie. Well, the only speaking one[^2]. His role was to steal chocolate from Wonka, to replay for the coco beans Wonka stole from Loompa Land. 

I was wondering how the movie would handle the Oompa Loompa. The trailer looked promising. But in short, the movie did it absolutely perfectly. The actor, the songs, and really everything about the Oompa Loompa, was bang on perfect. 

Speaking of actors, they were all also fantastic[^3]. Just hands down, great.

The songs though, there were a lot of them. Like, a lot. None of them were bad, they were all quite good. But the Oompa Loompa ones stole the show.

The story was, fine. It wasn't bad, it was quite fun. From Wonka falling in debt due to not being able to read[^4]. To breaking out of a launder-mat prison. The story was fun. 

Overall, I liked it. It wasn't fantastic, but it was fun.

TL;DR: If Keegan-Michael Key being chief of police sounds fun, give this a watch.

[^1]: More on that in the spoilers.

[^2]: Others do appear in a flash back, though they don't speak.

[^3]: Less so on the kid Noodle, but you can only expect so much from child actors.

[^4]: yes, he spent his hole life learning chocolate.
