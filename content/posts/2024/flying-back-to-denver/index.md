The time has come, time go get up super early. My flight is scheduled to depart at 06:25, so that meant I had to be up at that time, yesterday. Why yesterday you might ask? Southwest is a first come, first serve seating airline. To control the chaos, they have three boarding groups. And depending on when you check in, determines you boarding group, and position. The sooner you check in, the better boarding spot you get.

Good ol' BWI charges to use bag carts. So I had to whole all my stuff myself. Carrying skis, polls, and boots all in one hand isn't fun. At least they were in bags. Checking them in was easy. Southwest counts a ski bag, and boot bag, as one bag. I just had to tell the kiosk what I had, and hand them off.

As of this paragraph, I'm waiting for my plane. Like the [last time](/posts/flight-update-3/) I flew to Denver. I loaded up a bunch of videos on my mac to watch. This time, I didn't just grab a ton of plane crash videos. I grabbed some other stuff.

## The Gate
<hr>

My Flight this time is a direct route. That's pretty boring. I love exploring airports, so having a connection is big value add for me. So not having one kinda sucks. I'm also stuck on a 737-700, one of the smaller more cramped 737s. It's almost 5AM, time to get some food.

Now that I've had some food, it's time to board. I got up at 6AM yesterday to check in on the app[^1]. I managed to score spot B2, about as good as you can get without paying. Second in line, in the second line.

## The Flight
<hr>

In the second spot, of the second line, at the second gate, in the second terminal.

Boarding and take off went smoothly, far better than my last flight to Denver. Glad I don't have to add the [air craziness](/tags/air-crazyness/) tag to this post. We'll see about my flight home. But before that, I need to ski.

[^1]: With Southwest, you have to check in to get your boarding pass. Check in starts 24h before gate departure. The sooner you check in, the better boarding position you get. Your boarding position is just you spot in line to get on the plane. Once you get on board the plane, you can take whatever seat you want.
