Yesterday, I went back down to the System Source Museum in Baltimore Maryland[^1]. I already have a [post](/posts/2023/system-source-museum/) about that place. But, something new was opening up there.

<h2>National Electronics Museum</h2>
<hr>

The National Electronics Museum was moving into some of the extra space at System Source. It wasn't open yet, but System Source was having an open house, so I got take a peek.

They mostly had old radio equipment, and a whole lot of radar systems. I known very little about radar. So, I'm going to have to drag my  radar nerd friend down from Colorado.
