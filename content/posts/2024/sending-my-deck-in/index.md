Welp, this isn't fun. The left track pad on my Steam Deck OLED started dying. The haptics on it were getting pretty loud and clicky, and worse, it would stop taking touch inputs. The weird part, the track pad would start working again after a reboot. For about 15 minutes, then stop again.

I really didn't want to have to send it in, but I didn't have much of a choice. After some back and forth, and sending them a video. Valve sent me a shipping label, for warranty repair. They did highlight that I had to remove any third party components, in case they had to replace the Deck. So I yanked my 2TB after market SSD, and tossed the stock one back in.

I'm hoping this won't take that long. I picked up some games on sale right before this issue that I want to play. And I have a trip coming up in a few weeks. I really want to play Microsoft Flight Simulator on the plane.
