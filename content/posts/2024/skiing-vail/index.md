Itâ€™s time to do the thing I can all this way for, ski!

Vail was about a two hour drive from where I was staying. So that meant I got to drive on love fantastic looking mountain roads[^1].

Vail is big, like really big. Like, they have three trail maps big. I didn't take many pics while there. So here's one of me and my friend.
