I need to rethink somethings. I was adding a bigger buffer to my Kovarex plant, when an alarm went off. One I haven't heard in a long time. The power alarm. Right then and there, everything died on me... What the fuck just happened.

I got in the War Spider, and raced to the reactor. Turbines weren't spinning, she was dead. I quickly checked the reactor temps, 600C, and no fuel. I needed fuel, and fast, before these things cooled off too much. Racing up to my fuel plant, I found the problem, it ran out of iron plates. I'll fix that later, right now I just need to keep the reactors hot.

I grabbed some spare fuel, and raced back to the reactor. Once there, I isolated the plant from the rest of the factory, and loaded in the fuel. 515C, thatâ€™s what the reactors got down to. Now just to let them heat back up. 

So, why did I rush to get fuel? Simple, mass. My reactor is pretty big, and that gives it a lot of thermal mass. So, if it went completely cold, it would take quite awhile to heat back up.

I had to wait a bit for it to heat up enough. While this reactor can in thory make 1.1Gw, my base only uses about 160ishMw. The issue is, I have a lot of robo-ports. And when they loose power, their batteries will loose a bit of charge, as the bot return to them[^1]. When the power came back on, my base, for about two seconds, drew close too 600Mw. Good thing my plant can handle that.

I'm currently rebuilding/moving my fuel production plant, to help prevent this from happening again.

[^1]: The bots will finish their task and return to a robo-port in the event of a power outage.
